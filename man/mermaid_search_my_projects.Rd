\usage{
mermaid_search_my_projects(
  name = NULL,
  countries = NULL,
  tags = NULL,
  include_test_projects = FALSE,
  limit = NULL,
  token = mermaid_token(),
  field_report = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Project name}

\item{countries}{Project country. Projects are returned if the \code{countries} field contains \code{countries}, not just if it is exactly the same. For a list of countries used in MERMAID, see \code{\link{mermaid_countries}}}

\item{tags}{Project tags. Projects are returned if the \code{tags} field contains \code{tags}, not just if it is exactly the same.}

\item{include_test_projects}{Whether to include test projects. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{limit}{Number of records to get. Use NULL (the default) to get all records.}

\item{token}{API token. Not required for unauthenticated endpoints. Get manually via \code{\link{mermaid_auth}} or automatically when running a function that requires a token.}

\item{field_report}{Whether the output should be a "field report", i.e. a cleaned up version of the output with IDs mapped to names and only relevant fields shown. Defaults to TRUE, and setting to FALSE is not recommended outside of advanced usage.}
}
\description{

\examples{
\dontrun{
mermaid_search_my_projects(tags = "WCS Indonesia")
mermaid_search_my_projects(countries = "Indonesia", tags = "Vibrant Oceans")

# The country (or tag) do not have to be exactly the same
# A project is returned if it *contains* the country/tag:
mermaid_search_my_projects(tags = "WCS", limit = 1)[["tags"]]
# [1] "WCS Indonesia; Vibrant Oceans"

# To search all projects (not just yours), use mermaid_search_projects():
mermaid_search_projects(countries = "Fiji")
}
