mermaid_get_managements(
  limit = NULL,

  field_report = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{limit}{Number of records to get. Use NULL (the default) to get all records.}

\item{token}{API token. Not required for unauthenticated endpoints. Get manually via \code{\link{mermaid_auth}} or automatically when running a function that requires a token.}

\item{field_report}{Whether the output should be a "field report", i.e. a cleaned up version of the output with IDs mapped to names and only relevant fields shown. Defaults to TRUE, and setting to FALSE is not recommended outside of advanced usage.}
}
