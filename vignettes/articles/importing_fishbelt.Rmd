title: Ingesting legacy data into MERMAID
output: html_document
---



Do you have a lot of existing data and are just starting to use MERMAID? You might be wondering on how to import those data into MERMAID. You can import (ingest) your legacy data into MERMAID by using the mermaidr package. More info on the ingestion workflow with mermaidr can be seen on the [ingestion documentation](https://datamermaid.org/documentation/ingesting-legacy-data-using-r-studio).

Here we provide an example on how to import your fish data that uses the **fish belt method** into MERMAID using mermaidr. Please note that you need to **prepare your project in the app first** before starting this process. Detail on how to set a new project can be seen [here](https://datamermaid.org/documentation/setting-up-a-new-project). For this example, we have already prepared a project in the MERMAID app named **MERMAID reef survey**.

We have also prepared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgmz0vhg2QI" target="_blank">a video</a> to walk you through the ingestion process. You can download the [fishbelt](https://github.com/data-mermaid/mermaidr/tree/master/examples/import_historical_fishbelt/fishbelt.csv) and [sites](https://github.com/data-mermaid/mermaidr/tree/master/examples/import_historical_fishbelt/sites.csv) data for that example to follow along.

The steps for importing legacy fish belt data are:

1. Download the fish belt MERMAID template
2. Reformat your data to match the template
3. Address errors and warnings
4. Import (ingest) data to MERMAID

# 1. Download the fish belt MERMAID template

Before downloading the MERMAID template, make sure that you already have the mermaidr package installed. You can install the package from GitHub using the code below:


```r
remotes::install_github("data-mermaid/mermaidr")
```

In this example, we are going to also use the tidyverse package. The first step is to load the packages and access your MERMAID projects by using  `mermaid_search_my_projects()` with the project name.



At this point, a browser window will open for you to authenticate by logging into the MERMAID app. Once you've logged in, you can close the browser and come back to R. Your login credentials will last for a day and after it expires you will need to log in again.


```r
library(mermaidr)
library(tidyverse)

reef_survey <- mermaid_search_my_projects("MERMAID reef survey")
```

The next step is to get the fish belt MERMAID template and options using `mermaid_import_get_template_and_options()` and save it to a file called `fishbelt_mermaid_template.xlsx`.


```r
fish_template_and_options <- mermaid_import_get_template_and_options(
  reef_survey,
  "fishbelt",
  "fishbelt_mermaid_template.xlsx"
)
```

```
## Error: Please supply a project to get data from, either via the `project` argument or by using `mermaid_set_default_project()`.
```

<img src = "fishbelt_template.png" width = "75%" title = "Fish belt MERMAID template">

The XLSX file consists of the fish belt MERMAID template and the options that are tailored based on your project. For example, the site options that are accepted are all the sites that you have added in the project through the MERMAID app.


<img src = "fishbelt_template_sites.png" width = "50%" title = "Site options">


```
## Error in fish_template_and_options[["Observer emails *"]][["choices"]] <- tibble(value = "email@mermaid.org"): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

You can also preview the template in R:


```r
fish_template_and_options[["Template"]]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

Or if you want to investigate the column names in R, you can use the code below:


```r
names(fish_template_and_options)
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

All column names with asterisk shows that it is mandatory. You can leave the columns without the asterisk blank if the data is not available.

Investigate all the available options for each column before adjusting the format. For example, to look at the options for site in R:


```r
fish_template_and_options[["Site *"]]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

# 2. Reformat your data to match the template

After downloading the fish belt MERMAID template, you're ready to start reformatting your data. In this example, we are using a fish belt width of 5 m for fish size 10-34 cm, and 20 m for fish size bigger than 34 cm. We also identify the fish size up to the closest cm.

The first step is to read in your data. We have prepared our data in a CSV file and stored it in our project directory.

We read our fish belt data (stored in `fishbelt.csv` file) and our sampling event data (stored in `sites.csv` file), and save it to two different objects in R.




```r
fishbelt_data <- read_csv("fishbelt.csv")
sites_data <- read_csv("sites.csv")
```

The MERMAID ingestion template requires the sample event data and the observation data to be combined. Therefore, we need to add the `sites` data set to fish observation data. Look at the available columns in the `site` and `fishbelt` data sets:


```r
sites_data
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 8
##   SiteID Zone     Year Month   Day Reef_slope visibility current
##    <dbl> <chr>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>           <dbl> <chr>  
## 1   1208 Control  2021     3    15 slope              15 low    
## 2   1206 Control  2021     3    15 slope              15 low
```

```r
fishbelt_data
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 × 8
##    SiteID Depth Transect_length Width Transect_number `Fish species`     Size_cm
##     <dbl> <dbl>           <dbl> <dbl>           <dbl> <chr>                <dbl>
##  1   1208     5               5     5               1 Parupeneus multif…      15
##  2   1208     5               5    20               1 Acanthurus bariene      37
##  3   1208     5               5    20               1 Platax teira            37

##  5   1208     5               5    20               1 Parupeneus indikus      36
##  6   1208     5               5     5               1 Acanthurus aurant…      17
##  7   1208     5               5    20               1 Plectorhinchus ch…      36
##  8   1208     5               5     5               1 Zanclus cornutus        10
##  9   1208     5               5    20               1 Variola albimargi…      36
## 10   1208     5               5    20               1 Lutjanus sp.            36
## # ℹ 1 more variable: Abundance <dbl>
```

Then combine the `site` data to `fishbelt` data, joining on the `SiteID` identifier.


```r
fishbelt_data <- fishbelt_data %>%
  left_join(sites_data, by = "SiteID")
```

Looking at the available data, there are still two mandatory fields that are not yet added (Fish size bin and Observer emails) and one mandatory field that need to be adjusted ( Fishbelt Width). We need to look at the options allowed for these columns:


```r
fish_template_and_options[["Width *"]]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

```r
fish_template_and_options[["Fish size bin *"]]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

```r
fish_template_and_options[["Observer emails *"]]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

Now that we know the available options, we are going to add them manually using the code below:


```r
fishbelt_data <- fishbelt_data %>%
  mutate(
    `Width *` = "Mixed: >10 cm & <35 cm @ 5 m, >=35 cm @ 20 m",
    `Fish size bin *` = 1,
    `Observer emails *` = "email@mermaid.org"
  )
```

The visibility data are not the same as the options accepted by MERMAID:


```r
fishbelt_data %>%
  distinct(visibility)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   visibility
##        <dbl>
## 1         15
```

Let's check how it is formatted in template and implement the option into our data:


```r
fish_template_and_options[["Visibility"]][["choices"]]
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

```r
fishbelt_data <- fishbelt_data %>%
  mutate(visibility = case_when(
    visibility == 1 ~ "<1m - bad",
    visibility == 5 ~ "1-5m - poor",
    visibility > 5 & visibility <= 10 ~ "5-10m",
    visibility >= 10 ~ ">10m - excellent"
  ))
```

You might already noticed that the column names in our dataset are not the same with the template, and you might be wondering if it should be the same. The answer is **yes, they must have exactly the same name** but not necessarily the same order. Lets rename and reorder the columns. First check the names in the template and in our data:


```r
names(fish_template_and_options[["Template"]])
```

```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```


```r
names(fishbelt_data)
```

```
##  [1] "SiteID"            "Depth"             "Transect_length"  
##  [4] "Width"             "Transect_number"   "Fish species"     
##  [7] "Size_cm"           "Abundance"         "Zone"             
## [10] "Year"              "Month"             "Day"              
## [13] "Reef_slope"        "visibility"        "current"          
## [16] "Width *"           "Fish size bin *"   "Observer emails *"
```

Don't worry if you don't have any of `Sample time`, `Transect label`, `Relative depth`, `Tide`, `Sample unit notes` information, because none of them are required. It will not prevent you from importing (ingesting) your data into MERMAID. However, if you have those data, it is strongly recommended to add them as well.

Next step is to rename and reorder the columns in one step:


```r
fishbelt_data <- fishbelt_data %>%
  select(
    `Site *` = SiteID,
    `Management *` = Zone,
    `Sample date: Year *` = Year,
    `Sample date: Month *` = Month,
    `Sample date: Day *` = Day,
    `Depth *` = Depth,
    `Transect number *` = Transect_number,
    `Transect length surveyed *` = Transect_length,
    `Width *`,
    `Fish size bin *`,
    `Reef slope` = Reef_slope,
    `Visibility` = visibility,
    `Current` = current,
    `Observer emails *`,
    `Fish name *` = `Fish species`,
    `Size *` = Size_cm,
    `Count *` = Abundance
  )

fishbelt_data
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 × 17
##    `Site *` `Management *` `Sample date: Year *` `Sample date: Month *`
##       <dbl> <chr>                          <dbl>                  <dbl>

##  2     1208 Control                         2021                      3
##  3     1208 Control                         2021                      3

## 10     1208 Control                         2021                      3

```

# 3. Address errors and warnings

After reformatting our data, we're going to clean our data using `mermaid_import_check_options()` We need to check the columns one by one to ensure the data are accepted by the MERMAID template. The code below is to check our data that we've reformatted against the fish belt template we've downloaded. If the data matches, then a check mark will appear:


```r
mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, "Site *")
```

```
## Error in mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, : object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

```r
mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, "Management *")
```

```

```

```

```

```r

```

```
## Error in mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, : object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
## Error in mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, : object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

There are issues in the Fish name that need to be fixed, marked by the `FALSE` note under the match column. MERMAID also provides the closest choice to help us with data cleaning. We need to fix theses issues to be able to ingest our data:


```r
fishbelt_data <- fishbelt_data %>%
  mutate(`Fish name *` = case_when(
    `Fish name *` == "Parupeneus multifaskiatus" ~ "Parupeneus multifasciatus",
    `Fish name *` == "Parupeneus indikus" ~ "Parupeneus indicus",
    `Fish name *` == "Lutjanus sp." ~ "Lutjanus",
    TRUE ~ `Fish name *`
  ))
```

After fixing the issues, lets check again the values to makes sure we receive a check mark to move forward with the process.


```r
mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, "Fish name *")
```

```
## Error in mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, : object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

And finish checking the columns.


```r
mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, "Size *")
```

```
## Error in mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, : object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

```r
mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, "Count *")
```

```
## Error in mermaid_import_check_options(fishbelt_data, fish_template_and_options, : object 'fish_template_and_options' not found
```

Once we got the check marks, we have the cleaned version of our data that is ready to be ingested. Let's save the cleaned fishbelt data:




```r
write_csv(fishbelt_data, "fishbelt_clean.csv")
```



# 4. Import (ingest) data to MERMAID

Once we have our cleaned MERMAID formatted data, the next step is ingesting the data. We do one "dry run" before actually ingesting to check the data once more:


```r
mermaid_import_project_data(
  fishbelt_data,
  reef_survey,
  method = "fishbelt",
  dryrun = TRUE
)
```

```
## Error: Please supply a project to get data from, either via the `project` argument or by using `mermaid_set_default_project()`.
```

Once we got the message **Records successfully checked!**, change the `dryrun` option to `FALSE` to start ingesting your data into MERMAID. Once you got the message **Records successfully imported! Please review in Collect.**, you can head to the `Collecting Page` in your project in the MERMAID app and start validating and submitting each transect.


```r
mermaid_import_project_data(
  fishbelt_data,
  reef_survey,
  method = "fishbelt",
  dryrun = FALSE
)
```

```
## Error: Please supply a project to get data from, either via the `project` argument or by using `mermaid_set_default_project()`.
```
